Description: Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int l = 0, r = height.length - 1, maxArea = 0;
        while (l < r) {
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, Math.min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l));
            if (height[l] < height[r]) 
                l++;
            else r--;
